# Python Coding Exercises

This repository contains a collection of guided coding exercises designed to reinforce the principles and methods introduced in the **Introduction to Python** DataCamp course. The exercises focus on Python fundamentals, including working with lists, numpy arrays, and pandas data frames.

## Repository Contents
This repository contains three Colab notebooks:
- **Coding_Exercises_Intro_Python.ipynb**
- **Numpy_Basics.ipynb**
- **Pandas_Exercises.ipynb**

## Intro Python
These exercises focus on practicing the basics of Python, including working with lists and understanding Python's core principles. The application involves a small data set containing information about electric cars.

**Goal:** Gain experience and confidence working with lists and basic Python operations.

## Numpy Basics
These exercises are designed to reinforce the numpy array, an important data object in Python frequently used to organize and work with data sets.

**Goal:** Build familiarity with numpy arrays and learn how to perform various operations on them.

## Pandas Exercises
In these exercises, we will explore pandas, a powerful tool for organizing and working with data sets in Python. The exercises will help you build familiarity with pandas DataFrames, their features, and functions.

**Goal:** Develop proficiency with pandas DataFrames and learn to manipulate data sets effectively.
